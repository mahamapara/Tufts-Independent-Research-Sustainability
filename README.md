# Exploring the Relationship between American belief in Climate Change, NSF Funding and Political Leanings

### For: Independent Graduate Research Project (MS in Data Science @ Tufts)

Summary;

This analysis focused on exploring the American public opinion on climate change in 3 ways.
1. How is funding on climate change focused research related to public opinion on climate change (state level)?
2. How is public opinion on climate change related to political leaning (county level)?
3. How is public opinion on climate change related to monetary and human costs of climate-related change (county-level)?

As such, the research questions were:
- On a national/state level, is there a positive correlation between national sentiment on climate change in the US and NSF funding towards climate change related research?
- On a county level, is there a positive correlation between public opinion on climate change in the US and political leaning?
- On a county level, is there a positive correlation between public opinion on climate change in the US and the monetary and human costs of climate change?
